title: Oh My AI! How RAG and LLMs are Rocking the Fashion and eCommerce Worlds
---
description:

With all the hype around AI, you would think it's just a passing fashion trend––but it's actually the up and coming search staple.  In this session we'll share how AI isn't all glitz and glamor, but provides real transformative potential for the fashion & eCommerce industries.  We'll demonstrate through real examples from ecommerce platforms, how AI enhances search functionalities, and helps overcome challenges of traditional keyword-based search by applying better semantic search that will be a game changer in a retail field dominated by images. Learn how   the multimodal image capabilities of LLMs are being optimized to surface better search results.


We'll share some of the less known (and likely less glamorous) parts powering the fashion industry, such as image recognition models to create embeddings, enabling more effective search queries that bridge the gap between textual inputs and visual outputs. This session will help attendees determine the best use cases for AI Search for their eCommerce platforms, and  how to implement AI-driven search systems using open-source tools, with practical examples and best practices tailored to the fashion industry––that can be applied to any visual and image heavy industry. The talk will also address the challenges of managing large volumes of image data and highlight future trends in AI for fashion, concluding with a look at powerful ecosystem tools that simplify advanced AI and image-based implementations.
