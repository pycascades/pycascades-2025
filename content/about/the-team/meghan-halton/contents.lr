bio: Meghan is a Software Engineering Manager, based out of Vancouver. She is passionate about bringing more folks from underrepresented communities into tech. She has worked with organizations such as Vancouver Datajam, PyLadies, Canada Learning Code as well as directly with schools in the Vancouver area to make that happen. In her free time Meghan reads, sews and knits her own wardrobe and is also trying to found a startup (so that people stop asking her to make them clothes).
