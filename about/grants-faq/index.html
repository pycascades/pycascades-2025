<h3>Q: What if I need help with a US visitor visa?</h3>
<p>A: We can provide you with an “Invitation Letter” upon request, in support of an application for a United States visitor visa. It confirms that as a registered delegate you are invited to attend PyCascades by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and the PyCascades 2024 committee.</p>
<h3>Q: What if I don’t come to PyCascades?</h3>
<p>A: If you do not register and attend PyCascades, you will not receive your grant. Please notify the Grants Committee that you cannot attend.</p>
<h3>Q: How and when will I receive my travel grant disbursement?</h3>
<p>A: The Python Software Foundation Accounting Team (accounting@python.org) will issue an electronic disbursement of funds within 7 business days after the completion of the conference, reimbursement method is provided, and receipts are submitted.</p>
<h3>Q: Can I be reimbursed for food?</h3>
<p>A: The Grant Committee automatically adds a per-diem rate for food for each Grant recipient. Please do not submit meal receipts.

Per-diems may only cover the days you are attending PyCascades and up to one travel day before and after conference attendance.</p>
<h3>Q: Can I be reimbursed for auto expenses or mileage if I am driving to PyCascades?</h3>

<h3>Q: How do I provide a hotel receipt when I haven’t checked out yet?</h3>
<p>A: A reservation confirmation from the hotel may be submitted as a receipt. The reservation confirmation should include the name and address of the hotel/motel/hostel/AirBnB, check-in and check-out dates, number of occupants, and the amount charged per day.</p>

<li>The amount of the transaction</li>
</ul>
<h3>Q: What payment options are available?</h3>
<p>A: You may choose to receive your Grant in one of the following payment methods:</p>

<li>ACH for US domestic bank accounts</li>
<li>Wire transfer for international payments</li>
<li>Wise for international payments</li>
<li>Physical check in USD</li>
