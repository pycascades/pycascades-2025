‚Äúlocal. Simple food from honest ingredients. Pure, regional, Italian.‚Äù The patio is usually open and heated but not always. You may need to call ahead. The food is so good, it‚Äôs one of the few places where one of our organizers cheats on their allergies.</p>

‚ÄúA must-visit, if not for its amazing menu, for the fact that it‚Äôs the nation‚Äôs first sports bar to exclusively show women‚Äôs sports. Chef and owner Jenny Nguyen created a menu based on traditional sports bar fare with nods to her Vietnamese upbringing. Packed with <a href="https://www.travelportland.com/culture/vegan-food/">vegan</a> and <a href="https://www.travelportland.com/culture/gluten-free-dining/">gluten-free</a> dining options, the drinks menu is equally inclusive, with great zero-proof drinks.</p>
